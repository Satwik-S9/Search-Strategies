**Description:** <br/>
In this script I have created all the basic search strategies employed in Artificial Intelligence.
These include but are not limited to the following: 

### Uninformed Search:

   1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
   2. Depth First Search (DFS)
   3. Uniform Cost Search

### Informed Search

   1. A Star Search

### Game Search
   1. Alpha-Beta Search


All These algorithms are implemented on the tree and the graph data-structures and are used to solve the shortest path problem.
